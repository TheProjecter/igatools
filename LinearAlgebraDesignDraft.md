# Linear Algebra Design Draft #

Philosophical principle:
A linear problem posed in a discrete space (simple, hierarchical, multipatch or generic space) has a corresponding linear algebra problem.

This main ingredient to define this linear algebra problem is the sparsity pattern arising from the discrete space.



The idea is to mimic this concept in the design.
| Field  | Vectors |
|:-------|:--------|
| Linear Constraints on basis function (Restriction on space)  | Linear Algebra constraints |
| LinearOperators  | Matrices (one space for test and one for trial functions) |


The interaction between the spaces and the linear algebra packages is handle in
the following way:

## Assembling ##

## Fields ##


## Blablabla ##
