# igatools (an isogeometric analisys library) #

igatools is an open source, modern designed general purpose isogeometric analysis software library to numerically solve partial differential equations using isogeometric spaces.

The library is implemented in C++11, its design is object oriented with extensive use of generic programming techniques (a.k.a. [template metaprogramming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming)).


Some of the features are:
  * Dimension independent code through templates
  * Support for parallel processing (shared and distributed memory)
  * Computational efficiency
  * Extensive and automatic test suite
  * Defensing programming
  * Extensive documentation


**igatools is in development stage, it is work in progress and should not be consideded stable**

Also this wiki is a work in progress, and parts of it may still be under construction, nevertheless you will find information concerning different aspects of the library.
