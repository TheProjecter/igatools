# About igatools #

igatools is a general purpose, open source library to numerically solve partial differential equations using isogeometric spaces.

The library is implemented in C++11, its design is object oriented with extensive use of generic programming techniques (a.k.a. templates metaprogramming).


Some of the features are:
  * Object oriented design
  * Dimension independent code through templates
  * Support for parallel processing (shared and distributed memory)
  * Computational efficiency
  * Extensive and automatic test suite
  * Modern bug tracking system
  * Defensing programming
  * Extensive documentation
  * Community support through user group and wiki pages

igatools originated as a project in the isogeometric analysis group at the Mathematics Department of the University of Pavia and the Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche (IMATI).
The isogeometric analysis group at Pavia is a world leading group composed of several scientists in mathematics and engineering that have contributed with their work to the theoretical and computational development isogeometric analysis (IgA).
