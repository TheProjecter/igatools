# igatools (an isogeometric analysis library) #

igatools is an open source, modern designed general purpose isogeometric analysis software library to numerically solve partial differential equations using isogeometric spaces.

The library is implemented in C++11, its design is object oriented with extensive use of generic programming techniques (a.k.a. _templates metaprogramming_).


Some of the features are:
  * Object oriented design
  * Dimension independent code through templates
  * Support for parallel processing (shared and distributed memory)
  * Computational efficiency
  * Extensive and automatic test suite
  * Modern bug tracking system
  * Defensive programming
  * Extensive documentation
  * Community support through user group and wiki pages


**igatools is in development stage, it is work in progress and should not be considered stable**

Also this wiki is a work in progress, and parts of it may still be under construction, nevertheless you will find information concerning different aspects of the library.
