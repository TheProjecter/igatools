After installing the library, the suggested starting point for a new user
is the tutorial.
The tutorial consists of a set of simple example programs, each of which teaches the user some use of the library. They also suggest the user some modifications to allow him for hands-on learning.

To access the tutorial, you need to generate the igatools documentation as explained [here](Documentation.md), and then start your browser and open the documentation.
```
firefox $IGATOOLS_PREFIX/doc/html/index.html
```
To access the tutorial click the Tutorial link on the left.

In order to do the exercises you need to modify a source file. This will require a text editor, is up to you to pick one. Be advised (in case this is your first time dealing with a C++ project) that there many convenient development environments (IDE). Some examples are Eclipse, KDevelopment, XCode, Emacs, Vim, etc.

We don't enforce any particular one, but have been using Eclipse and wrote some [notes on it](UsingEclipse.md).
